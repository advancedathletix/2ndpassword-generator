# 2ndpassword-generator

In this project I first added a prompt to ask how many character you want in your password when you click the generate password button

I then added a confirm alert to ask if you wanted uppercase, lower case,numbers and, or symbols in your password

then I created the array of numbers, letters and symbols for the webpage to pick from 
I also created an empty array function for the webpage to add the characters the webpage chooses to use

Then I made sure the letters, numbers and symbols it chose were random by using a loop 

I added if  statments to tell it if the user udecideds to use certain character such as symbols to then choose at random the symbols from the symbolsarray 

I also did this with uppercase, lowercase and the number array

theThen I added else statments to tell the webpage to show an alert to let the user know if they didnt chose certain characters
